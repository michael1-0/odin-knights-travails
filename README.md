# odin-knights-travails

Project submission for The Odin Project: Knights Travails. I was tasked to make an implicit graph data structure based on knight's moves; the goal of the project was to calculate shortest path that is the hops between starting location and desired ending location of a knight's L shaped move, did it using breadth-first search logic. To run simply use `node` command that comes with Node.
